        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>I am a passionate Computer Science and Engineering student who believes that technology is not just about code, but about solving real-world problems with innovation and purpose.I enjoy transforming ideas into practical solutions — from AI-based security concepts like Super AI Secure Smartphone to projects focused on cybersecurity, automation, and smart systems. I have a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence, Cyber Security, and innovative product development, and I constantly challenge myself to think beyond conventional approaches.As a quick learner, I adapt fast to new technologies and tools once I understand the core concept. I actively work on improving my technical skills through hands-on projects, internships, and selflearning. I also enjoy web design, creative thinking, and presenting ideas in a clear and impactful way.My goal is to build technology that is secure, intelligent, and meaningful — technology that genuinely helps people. I am always open to learning, collaborating, and contributing to innovative teams that value creativity and growth.</p>
